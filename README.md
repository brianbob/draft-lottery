# Project Title

A simple program to randomly determine an order for a group.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Instalation

All you have to do is clone the repo somewhere local.

```
git clone git@github.com:brianbob/draft-lottery.git [folder-name]
```

### Usage

The program takes a list (can be any size) to randomize.

Example:

```

The program will randomize the list 10,000 times and output it to the screen.

```
Shuffle number #1
Shuffle number #2
...
Shuffle number #9999
Shuffle number #10000

Now for the FINAL draft order!
